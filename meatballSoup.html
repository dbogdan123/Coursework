		<p class="recipeDesc">
			A meatball soup that is suitable for a meal before a whole day workout or can be used as a meal before a regular workout on its own. The choice of ingredients of a meal is vital. This is why we chose 
			turkey/chicken meatballs, onions, spinach and couscous.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p class="ingredientDesc">
			<strong> Spinach: </strong> Spinach is full of Vitamin A, C and K. Spinach also helps to manage blood pressure and helps prevent cardiovascular diseases.
		</p>
		
		<p class="ingredientDesc">
			<strong> Turkey meatballs: </strong> Turkey meatballs are great substitute to beef or pork meatballs. Any of the four types of meatballs could be used for this soup, however, turkey and chicken meatballs are the 
			-advised- healthy options.
		</p>
		
		<p class="ingredientDesc">
			<strong> Onions: </strong> Onions help the immune system to fight off sickness and harmful bacteria, which makes this soup suitable to allow you to workout even when you're feeling sick. Onions are great source of 
			Vitamin C, Vitamin B and potassium.
		</p>
		
		<p class="ingredientDesc">
			<strong> Couscous: </strong> Couscous is a healthier alternative to white rice. It is also full of fibre and plant-based protein. It can be used in this soup because of the benefits it brings to your diet and the
			amount of energy it adds to your workout meal.
