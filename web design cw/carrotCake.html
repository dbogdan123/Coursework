			A delicious treat to finish a workout meal or a hard workout. Healthy, delicious and easy to make, what else can you ask for? Here are some substitutes or extras you can add to this cake.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p class="ingredientDesc">
			<strong> Gluten free flour: </strong> Gluten free flour is very healthy, and has high nutritional advantages, such as protein, fiber, vitamins etc. Gluten free flour is finer than all purpose flour, therefor, 
			if you wish to switch to gluten free flour, you need to consider the adjustments of the liquid ingredients accordingly. Substitute by weight, not volume!
		</p>
		
		<p class="ingredientDesc">
			<strong> Walnuts: </strong> It is very optional if you wish to add walnuts to it or not. A decoration never hurts, especially if it is nutrient and Vitamin B rich. Pecans could be a good substitute for people with
			walnut allergy.

			<li>
				1 Tbsp Baking Powder
			</li>
			<li>
				1 tsp Cinnamon
			</li>
			<li>
				1 tsp Ginger
			</li>
			<li>
				1 tsp Nutmeg
			</li>
			<li>
				1/2 tsp Cloves
			</li>
			<li>
				1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Wet Ingredients</h2>
	
		<ul class="ingredientList">
			<li>
				3 large Eggs
			</li>
			<li>
				1 1/2 C (360g) Unsweetened Apple Sauce
			</li>
			<li>
				2-3 (150g) Carrots, finely grated
			</li>
			<li>
				1 tsp Vanilla Extract
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>For the Cream Cheese Frosting</h2>
		
		<ul class="ingredientList">
			<li>
				16 oz Fat Free Cream Cheese, or 1/3 fat
			</li>	
			<li>
				1 C (144g) Powdered Erythritol
			</li>
			<li>
				1 C (120g) Chopped Walnuts, optional
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		
		<ol class="ingredientList">
			<li>
				Preheat an oven to 176°C(350°F) and spray two 20cm(8") cake pans with nonstick spray. Set aside.
			</li>
			<li>
				Whisk the eggs together before adding the apple sauce, grated carrots, and vanilla extract. Set aside.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl before gradually stirring in the egg mixture. Be sure you don't have any dry patches of flour but don't over mix the batter.
			</li>
			<li>
				Transfer the batter to the two cake pans. Each pan should have roughly 530 grams in each unless you modified the recipe. Shake each cake pan to evenly distribute the batter and gently smack a flat surface with 
				the bottom of the cake pan to remove any air bubbles.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bake for 22-25 minutes or until the cakes are cooked through in the center. (If you bake the cake in one large pan, you may need to bake for 30-40 minutes.)
			</li>
			<li>
				Remove the carrot cakes from the oven and after they've cooled for a few minutes, transfer them to a cooling rack. Set the cream cheese out to warm to room temp.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once the cakes have fully cooled, mix the cream cheese and powdered sugar substitute together. Frost the first cake before placing the second cake on top and frosting the top and sides. Gently pat the sides of 
				the cake with walnuts in your hands to coat the sides.
			</li>
