			Spaghetti, is a great and well loved dish, this is why we made a healthy version with prawns instead of pork or beef. We have also added some extra ingredients to make the dish full of vitamins and even more healthy.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p class="ingredientDesc">
			<strong> Broccoli: </strong> Broccolis are full of Vitamin C and K, iron and potassium. Broccolis are good for heart and eye health and they contain cancer protective compounds.
		</p>
		
		<p class="ingredientDesc">
			<strong> Prawns: </strong> Prowns are full of B group of vitamins and provide 22 times of Vitamin E levels of either chicken or beef. Prawns contain antioxidants that may protect against heart diesase and cancer.
		</p>
		
		<p class="ingredientDesc">
			<strong> Garlic: </strong> Garlic is full of Vitamin C and B6 and magnasse. Garlic can protect against illness, can reduce blood pressure and improve cholesterol levels.
